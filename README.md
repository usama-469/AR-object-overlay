## Introduction
The Cross-Platform AR Object Detection App is an augmented reality application that uses Unity, Vuforia and the Model Target Generator to recognize and overlay AR content on real-world objects. Users can provide a set of 3D models of real-world objects, and whenever these objects are detected, the app displays relevant information and animations as an overlay. This app has vast applications in various fields, including retail, tourism, education, and development, where interactive and informative overlays can enhance user experience.

## Features
- **Vuforia Object Detection:** Utilizes Vuforia’s powerful object detection capabilities to recognize real-world objects based on provided 3D models.
- **Model Target Generator:** Generate model targets from 3D models to accurately detect objects in the real world.
- **AR Overlays:** Automatically display informative AR overlays and animations when objects are detected.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on both Android and iOS, making it accessible to a wide audience.
- **Scalable Applications:** Can be used in various industries, including retail (for product information), tourism (for historical facts), education (for interactive learning), and development (for prototype visualization).

## Usage
1. **Setup and Installation:**
   - As the app is not published, download the source code from the repository.
   - Build the APK for Android or side-load the app for iOS using Xcode.

2. **Adding 3D Models:**
   - Use the Model Target Generator to create model targets from your 3D models.
   - Upload the generated model targets into the app through the provided interface.

3. **Object Detection and AR Overlay:**
   - Launch the app and point your device’s camera at the real-world objects.
   - When an object matching the model target is detected, the app will automatically overlay information and animations onto the object.

4. **Customization and Use Cases:**
   - Customize the information and animations associated with each detected object to suit different use cases.
   - Explore various scenarios, such as in-store product information, historical site tours, educational displays, or prototype visualization.
